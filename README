This project aims to write a client/server CoreWar runner in 100% Javascript.

See http://www.corewar.info/

How to test:
 - node tests/parser.js : test parsing on one warrior (edit file to change it)
 - node tests/88all.js : run unitest comparing both versions in warriors/88/ 
 - node tests/battle.js : run a battle between 2 imps (and soon more!)

TODO:
 - fix last few bugs in the parser
 - create a nice browser GUI for showing battles
